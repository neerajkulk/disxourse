# Overarching goal:
Incentivize people to upvote/downvote and leave comments. Create a community

### Next Steps:
* treat partials like functions (the data it takes are arguements to the functions). It should be clear exactly what data each partial should take
* you should be able to open the PDF in a seperate page
* sort comments by date (Either add date object to upvotes or do an aggregation)
* make sure latex renders on all relevant pages
* create user page
* weekly mail digest
* notifications on new-comment
* create a skim-mode where a small iframe opens up right under the paper in the main feed. 
* delete papers if they have recieved no engangement after 30 days
* Pre-2007 arxiv ID query is broken.
* edit comments?
* restructure about page
* add render latex button
* Add search tab (Users can search for features)
* Fix twitter link once I have a domain name
* Oauth routs should link back to current page. Not send you to main page. 
* add footer with some copyright shit
* set up donation buttons
* Add favicon 
* Before big launch have a DB backup incase I push some crappy code. 
* Should I minify JS and CSS files?
* if for some reason people dont want their paper on my page, there should be an option
* button to open pdf in new tab if PDF looks small in iframe ()
* See what I can learn from paperswithcode


### Features to add:
* mongoose query to count if documents might be slow. Speed up if performance is an issue
* Notifications for comments and upvotes (allow users to follow a paper)
* Create news letter of top arxiv papers for the week
* record group meetings and link to provide links to youtube videos
