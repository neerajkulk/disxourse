Overarching goal:
Incentivize people to upvote/downvote and leave comments. Create a community

Next Steps:
[] Minimize front-end JS. Keep it simple, servers-side + EJS templates
[] Did this user vote this item up or down
[] Make sure stuff works if you're not logged in...
[] How many people voted up or down on this item
[] Notification if user not logged in
[] ensureAuth API upvote, downvote routes. 
[] Add Publication date to frontend
[] Use card class to make things look nicer
[] Turn callbacks into promises/async await
[] Add search tab
[] Set up email notification for comments for authors. (does arxiv provide email addresses?)
[] protect auntheticated routes
[] make sure you wrap async await in try-catch block and user .catch on .then on promises. 
[] Is Mathjax rendering on all relevent pages?
