# Overarching goal:
Incentivize people to upvote/downvote and leave comments. Create a community

### Next Steps:
* email forwarding should work 
* make sure there's a backlink from patreon
* want to help develop the website? Get in touch
* link to twitter profile, ORCID-ID and other media
* Add ad a progress bar based on donation.
* Do basic SEO (bare minimum, dont go down a rabbit hole here)
* weekly mail digest
* delete papers if they have recieved no engangement after 30 days
* Pre-2007 arxiv ID query is broken.
* Before big launch have a DB backup incase I push some crappy code. 
* Should I minify JS and CSS files?

### Directions:
* On a paper, we should be seeing if it cites other papers with a discussion. 
* see relevent papers in single page
* record group meetings and link to provide links to youtube videos
* add voting on comments and creat a stack-overflow reputation system
* autocomplete @ when tagging users
* search bar for users
* Establish some guidelines, or even rules, for comments
* delete button on comments?
* if for some reason people dont want their paper on my page, there should be an option
