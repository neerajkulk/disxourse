* Do basic SEO (bare minimum, dont go down a rabbit hole here)
* Do i want a cleaner modern landing page
* you should be able to open the PDF in a seperate page
* weekly mail digest
* delete papers if they have recieved no engangement after 30 days
* Pre-2007 arxiv ID query is broken.
* add content to about page
* Fix twitter link once I have a domain name
* add footer with some copyright shit
* set up donation buttons
* Add favicon 
* Before big launch have a DB backup incase I push some crappy code. 
* Should I minify JS and CSS files?

### Directions:
* record group meetings and link to provide links to youtube videos
* add voting on comments and creat a stack-overflow reputation system
* autocomplete @ when tagging users
* search bar for users
* Establish some guidelines, or even rules, for comments
* delete button on comments?
* if for some reason people dont want their paper on my page, there should be an option
