# Overarching goal:
Incentivize people to upvote/downvote and leave comments. Create a community

### Next Steps:
* Read arXiv api and figure out best way to download all astro papers (without specifying category)
* Use card class to make things look nicer
* Add search tab (Users can search for features)
* Set up email notification for comments for authors. (does arxiv provide email addresses?)
* protect auntheticated routes
* Fix twitter link once I have a domain name
* Oauth routs should link back to current page. Not send you to main page. 
* add footer
* remember to add .lean() to mongoose queries when you dont need to save back to DB
* Add favicon 
* THink of a more elegent way of passing data to template instead of creating the myData object each time. 
* Create error files to render in catch statements
* Should I minify JS and CSS files?
* have clear call to action to login on landing page
* if for some reason people dont want their paper on my page, there should be an option
* button to open pdf in new tab if PDF looks small in iframe
* See what I can learn from paperswithcode
* User refs and populate in mongoose. Red docs to see how this works
* Read mongoose docs for FindOneAndUpdate and FindOneAndDelete or Remove. See if it makes sense to use these functions in the Upvote. 
* Create news letter of top arxiv papers for the week

### Features to add:
* In Related papers, show cited papers
* mongoose query to count if documents might be slow. Speed up if performance is an issue
* Notifications for comments and upvotes (allow users to follow a paper)
