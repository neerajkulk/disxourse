* add render latex button
* Add search tab (Users can search for features)
* Fix twitter link once I have a domain name
* Oauth routs should link back to current page. Not send you to main page. 
* add footer with some copyright shit
* set up donation buttons
* Add favicon 
* Before big launch have a DB backup incase I push some crappy code. 
* Should I minify JS and CSS files?
* if for some reason people dont want their paper on my page, there should be an option
* button to open pdf in new tab if PDF looks small in iframe ()
* See what I can learn from paperswithcode
